# ArduinoGuitarHeroGripKeyboard

This was a dumb project for the Stupid Hackathon 2024 at https://stupidhackathon.se


The controller works like how binary counting works where the blue button on the Guitar Hero Grip controller is the first button (or the least significant bit in binary) and the green button is the last button (or the 4th least significant bit in binary)

Don't try typing on this at home unless you want severe hand pains and/or carpal tunnel
